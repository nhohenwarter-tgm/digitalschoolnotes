\section*{Abstract}

Nowadays most people can't think of a world without internet anymore. It is used almost always and everywhere you are - also in schools. Students are getting more and more into digital notes, especially in technical oriented schools, where they have their laptop always with them. There is only one problem: These digital notes are often written in different programs. They are unorganized and mostly left in some directory where they aren't opened once afterwards.\\
The project DigitalSchoolNotes was formed exactly because of this problem. Our webapplication can organize digital notes and make it easier to write them. It is made from students themselves to fit the needs of students optimal. The application can be accessed from almost every device - personal computers, laptops and even tablets. Furthermore it is possible to use a mobile phone to take a photo and put it into the digital notes easy and conveniently. Particularly fitted for technical schools there is also the possibility to insert some code-snippets into the digital notes, which are correctly formatted and highlighted.\\
All of which is to allow students to write tidy, organized, digital notes and to make learning from these easier and more efficient.
